//Multiplication

--DaysUntilHoliday;
------------------------
++Variable
--Variable

Effect: Increment/decrement the variable by one and return its value already increased/reduced.

Variable++
Variable--

Effect: Return the original (unchanged) variable's value and then increment/decrement the variable by one.
